# DevOps Exercise

This is a skeleton repository for your exercise. 
The goal of this exercise is to implement a Python package for sorting integer 
lists using the DevOps software development approach.

> **Warning**: If working on windows, some directories and files in this archive
will not be visible because they start with a '.'. In the file browser, change 
the View to display "Hidden items".

You will need to:
1. Add .pre-commit-config.yml which:  
    - Limits maximal file size.
    - Runs the black and flake8 linters.
    - Detect presence of aws credentials private keys.    
2. Implement the algorithms for bubble, quick and insertion sort, see sort_lib directory,
code should be documented using standard Python practices (there are several [docstring 
styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-is-the-standard-python-docstring-format)
select one and be consistent).
3. Implement testing using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework, see test directory.
4. Implement linting, style checking using both [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and 
[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
5. Modify the GitHub actions workflow so that it tests and builds the package for all 
three operating systems (OSX/Linux/Win) and for Python versions 3.9 and 3.10. Read more about [Distributing Python packages](https://docs.python.org/3/distributing/index.html).
6. Modify this file to describe this repository and the DevOps workflow you implemented (add badges to this file showing testing status).
7. **Optional**: Add a job to the workflow which uploads the wheel to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/). As every package on TestPyPI is required to have a unique name you need to update the UNIQUE_SUFFIX both in the directory name and in the .toml file. Possibly use your team number.
    >**Warning**: Do not upload to the authoritative Python Package Index (PyPI).
